# Genetic-Algorithms-in-C

This repository contains C implementations of various optimization problems solved using **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**. These problems are inspired by the book "*Hands-On Genetic Algorithms with Python*" by **Eyal Wirsansky**, which solves them using the DEAP library in Python.

Rather than relying on external libraries, this project focuses on implementing Genetic Algorithms from scratch in C. The goal is to dive deep into the core mechanics of GA, gaining a fundamental understanding of how selection, mutation, and crossover drive the evolutionary process.

# Problems Implemented
- One Max Problem: A classic binary optimization problem with obvious best solution.
- Knapsack Problem: Optimizing item selection to maximize value within weight constraints.
- Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): Finding the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once.
- Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP): Optimizing delivery routes for multiple vehicles.
- N-Queen Problem â€“ Placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
